## 5.4 Technical Architecture

### 5.4.1 Distributed System Design

```
Architecture = {
  Edge_Nodes: Local_Trust_Processing,
  Regional_Hubs: Pattern_Aggregation,
  Global_Layer: Emergence_Detection,
  Storage: IPFS + Blockchain_Optional
}
```

### 5.4.2 Privacy-First Data Flow

- End-to-end encryption for private exchanges
- Zero-knowledge proofs for trust verification
- Differential privacy in analytics
- User-controlled data sovereignty

### 5.4.3 Scalability Considerations

- Edge computing reduces central load
- Lazy evaluation of distant connections  
- Caching of trust paths
- Progressive detail loading
