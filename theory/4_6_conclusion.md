## 4.6 Conclusion

The constructive trust network model inverts every assumption of the attention economy:
- Deep over wide
- Trust over metrics
- Reciprocal over extractive
- Sustainable over viral

By aligning platform mechanics with human psychology and mathematical principles of trust propagation, we create systems that strengthen rather than erode human connection. The 1010 framework provides a concrete, achievable path to sustainable creator businesses built on genuine relationships rather than audience exploitation.

The future belongs not to those with the most followers but to those with the deepest trust.
