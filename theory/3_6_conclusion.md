3.6 Conclusion: The Necessity of New Models
Current platforms create destructive interference in human trust networks through:

Forcing unnatural interaction frequencies
Collapsing contexts and scrambling time

The next section presents such an alternative: constructive trust networks that amplify rather than destroy human relationships.
